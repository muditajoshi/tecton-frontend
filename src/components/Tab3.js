              We have come to realize that it is always “ordinary” people who at
              some point do the most extraordinary things. It is often a series
              of little moments or interactions that inspire and empower
              ordinary people to achieve great things.  
              <br />
              <br />
              Mike Chesne, my co-founder, was born and raised in rural Louisiana
              and grew up on various military bases where his father, a veteran,
              was stationed. Mike is also a veteran - a former Special Forces
              Combat Medic who has fought and participated in some of the most
              storied battles of the 21st century. While his bravery is beyond
              doubt (he is the recipient of two purple hearts), it is unlikely
              anyone would have expected him, an enlisted soldier, to be the
              developer of, what I believe, is a world changing nutrient. The
              nutrient that Tecton® is bringing to market.
              <br />
              <br />
              I, too, was born and raised on military bases. Mostly in rural
              India. My dad, a fighter pilot and a war hero, succumbed at the
              age of 59, to what would have been diagnosed, today, as PTSD. I
              went to 13 different schools and my grades were a mess. There was
              not a single person I know, friend or foe, who thought I’d amount
              to much when I was 18. But, with a fair amount of luck and a few
              great mentors, I was blessed with a global career with Coca-Cola
              within the next 10 years. It is there that I was fortunate to see
              “ordinary” people do extraordinary things.

                <b>Business: A Force For Good</b>
              </p>
              <br />
              I was accosted by an activist while I was running a global joint
              venture between Coca-Cola and Nestle. This opened my eyes to the
              power of business to shape the world. After playing a part in
              Coke’s shift towards healthier beverages, and launching a 100%
              Fairtrade and Carbon Neutral brand, and inspiring innovations like
              Coca-Cola Freestyle, I resigned from the company. I did not want
              to launch another beverage. Sugary or caffeine filled drinks full
              of artificial ingredients are not for me or my children.
              <br />
              <br />
              Mike has been “blown up” more than once in Iraq. He has seen
              people, soldiers and civilians lose life and limb. He dedicated
              his post-military career to helping set up healthcare
              infrastructure in the war torn countries he fought in. And while
              he was doing research for this, he came across a nutrient
              technology that DARPA, the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research
              Projects Agency (who he had worked for in the past) had invested
              millions of dollars in developing with the National Institute of
              Health and others. Exogenous ketones. He began to explore ways to
              refine this nutrient technology in 2014.

              I met Mike in 2015. Even though we come from, literally and
              figuratively, opposite ends of the world, we immediately built a
              bond based on a shared purpose:

              Thanks to my years at Coke and P&G, I am lucky to have an amazing
              network of food scientists and operations people who want to
              change the world. Mike and I joined forces and have spent the last
              7 years developing an amazing team and refining our product. We
              are grateful to people like Dr. Kevin Foley, M.D. the former Chief
              of Neurosurgery at Tripler Army Medical Center, and Walter Reed,
              who helped us fully understand the power of our nutrient
              technology. He is also our primary angel investor, and a veteran
              (he was a Lieutenant Colonel in the US Army). I am happy to have
              been forced to change my mind. Launching another beverage,
              something I swore I would never do again, is now something I can
              be proud of.

              The surface of the Earth, its mountains, valleys and oceans are

              Tecton® is that it helps the mitochondria in our cells metabolize
              energy in a far more efficient way. And when we are more alert,
              have more focus or endurance, we can make the most of every day
              little moments. One of these moments might potentially change our
              lives. Or shift the world. That’s why we are named Tecton®.
