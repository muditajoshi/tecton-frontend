        This Privacy Policy explains how Tecton (“Tecton”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collect, use, disclose, and otherwise

including related subdomains; (ii) our mobile, tablet and other smart device applications; (iii) application
program interfaces, (iv) in-store kiosks and other online services, and (iv) any other tools, technology and

          <br />
          <br />
          This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by us offline or through any other means, including

          <br />
          <br />

            <b>1.1. Data provided directly by you
</b>
        </h6>
        <p>
        <b> Contact and profile information.</b> When you create an Account, complete your Account profile, sign up for a
mailing list, or otherwise communicate or interact with us, we may collect information from you, such as your
name, phone number, e-mail address, and physical address. We use this contact and profile information to: (i)
create and personalize your Account; (ii) communicate with you directly about the services as well as about
any questions, issues or concerns you or other users may have, (iii) fulfill your order, and (iv) send you
marketing communications in accordance with your preferences.
<br/>
        <br/>
<b>Payment information.</b> When you submit an order or join our Platform you are required to provide payment
information, such as your credit card or debit card. For corporate Accounts that are used for business
purposes, we may also have corporate credit card numbers or other payment account numbers. We use this
payment information to fulfill your order, complete the transaction, and detect and prevent fraud.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Transaction information.</b> When you submit an order, we collect information, including the items purchased,
date and time of your transaction, special instructions, and points you accrue or rewards or promotions you
redeem as part of a loyalty or rewards program. We use this transaction information to fulfill your order,
update your rewards, detect and prevent fraud, personalize your experience, perform analytics/identify usage
trends, and inform our advertising and marketing.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Communications, Participation and other content.</b> We maintain all communications resulting from your
interactions with us or with Tecton Partners by email, phone, mail or chat. We also record comments and
opinions you express when responding to surveys, entering sweepstakes or taking part in promotions we run.
We use all of the foregoing communications to address your questions, issues and concerns and provide
other related customer support services, for safety and security purposes, to improve our Services, and for
analytics. We also maintain your ratings and reviews regarding Providers on the Platform, which we may post
for the benefit of all of our users.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Other information you provide.</b> With your permission, we may access your photos or contact list from your
mobile device, Facebook Messenger account or email account to enable you to share content or promotions
or invite your friends to connect with our Services, including through our friend referral program. If you are
ordering an alcoholic beverage(when applicable) or any other age restricted items, our Tecton Partners may
also collect the information contained on your government-issued identification card for age verification
purposes in order to complete the delivery.
We may also aggregate personal information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis,
research, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes as long as the
end-product does not uniquely identify you or any other user of the Services.
</p>
        <h6>
          <b>1.2. Personal Information Generated and/or Automatically Collected during your use of the Platform</b>
        </h6>
        <p>
        <b>Information about your device and its software.</b> Information about your device and its software includes
your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, device type/model/manufacturer, operating system,
date and time stamp, and a unique ID that allows us to identify your browser, mobile device, or your Account
(including, for example, a persistent device identifier or an Ad ID), and other similar information. We may also
work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including statistical modeling tools that permit us to
recognize and contact you across multiple devices. We use this device and software information to diagnose
and fix technology problems, serve you personalized advertising, personalize your experience, perform
analytics/identify usage trends, and improve our products and Services.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Information about the way you access and use our Services.</b> Information about the way you access and
use our Services includes the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave.
In addition, we track the pages you visit on the Platform, the links you click on the Platform, whether you open
emails or click the links contained in emails that we send, other actions you take on the Services, and whether
you access the Services from multiple devices. We may also use the information about the way you access
and use our Services to determine products and services that may be of interest to you, to improve our
products and Services, to evaluate the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, and to send you
marketing communications.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Analytics information.</b> We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google
Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends and the demographics of our users in order to improve
our Services. You can learn more about Google's practices at
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Location Information.</b> In some cases, you provide your location information to us directly (e.g. when you
provide us with a delivery address). In other cases, we may collect your location through GPS, WiFi, wireless
network triangulation or other methods, or we may otherwise infer your location based on other information
we collect. (For example, we can approximate your location by your IP Address.) We use location information
to customize content on our Services (e.g., show you the Providers that will deliver to your location and show
you relevant Perks), facilitate order and delivery Services, detect and prevent fraud, and measure traffic and
analytics on the Services. If you have previously opted into Tecton’s collection and use of location-based
information, we may collect and store the precise location of your device when the webapp is running in the
foreground or background of your device. You may opt-out by adjusting the settings on your mobile device.
We may also use the Google Maps API to gather information about your location. Google uses various
technologies to determine your location, including IP address, GPS and other sensors that may, for example,
provide Google with information on nearby devices, WiFi access points and cell towers (see the Google
privacy policy and the Google Maps terms of service to learn more).
We typically collect the foregoing generated and/or automatically collected information through a variety of
tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs,
location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”), and we may
use third-party partners or services to assist with this effort. Information we collect automatically about you or
your device may be combined with other personal information we collect directly.
We, or the third-party partners we use, may use the data collected automatically through tracking technologies
to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit
the Platform; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) identify and contact you across
multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (e) perform analytics and detect
usage patterns on our Services; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; (g) detect or prevent fraud or other
harmful activities, and (h) otherwise plan for and enhance our Services and for other internal purposes.

        </p>

          <b>1.3. Data from other sources</b>
        </h6>
        <p>
        <b>Information we receive from third-party sites you connect to our Services.</b> We may receive personal
information about you from third parties and combine that with information we collect through our Platform.
For example, we may obtain information when you login through a third-party social network or authentication
service, such as Facebook or Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the
option to share certain personal information with us, which could include your name, email address, address
book and contacts, or other information. Similarly, when you interact with us through a social media site or
third-party service, such as when you like, follow or share Tecton content on Facebook, Twitter, or other sites,
we may receive information that you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive
from these third-party sites is dependent upon that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that
third-party site.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Information we receive from affiliates or third parties.</b> From time to time, we may receive information
about you from our partners, in connection with our enterprise programs, from other Tecton entities and
affiliates, from co-marketing partners, service providers, and from other third parties. We may receive
additional information about you, such as fraud detection information, from third party partners and combine it
with other information that we have about you. We use this information from affiliates or third parties to create
your Accounts, to contact you, to send you advertising or promotional materials or to personalize our
Services, to protect against bot attacks and account takeovers, and to better understand the demographics of
our users.
<br/>
<br/>
We do not control, supervise or respond to how the third parties providing your information process your
personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us
should be directed to such third parties.

        </p>

        <h4>

<br/><br/>

with third parties and business partners.
<br/><br/>
<b>2.7. Other purposes disclosed at the time of collection.</b> From time to time, we may use personal
information for a specific purpose not contemplated by this Privacy Policy. In such an event, we will
specifically disclose that use to you.

        <h4>
          <b>3. Our Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information</b>
        </h4>
        We disclose personal information to the following types of third parties:
<br/>
        <p>
        <b>3.1. Partner Sharing.</b> We disclose personal information to third parties engaged by us (e.g. point of sale
partners or their own delivery personnel), as needed to fulfill your orders, including communicating with you
about the status of your order or canceled items.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3.2. Other Third Parties necessary to complete your order or to enable your use of the Platform and
Services.</b> We disclose personal information to other third parties as needed to fulfill your orders, including,
without limitation, delivery providers and payment processors.
3.4. Service providers and contractors. We disclose personal information to third parties that provide

marketing, and other similar services.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>3.5. Analytics providers.</b> We share personal information with third-party analytics providers to better
understand the demographics of our users and visitors, and to personalize, enhance and improve our

<br/>
<br/>
<b>3.6. Advertising, Marketing and Promotions providers.</b> We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to
outside parties your personally identifiable information, unless it is something you opted in to, or that we have
to in order to serve your needs. We may share site usage data with trusted third parties to generate site
analytics. We may also release your information when we believe release is necessary to comply with the law,
enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ safety.
In the future, and only if you opt in to these, we may share personal information with third parties in
connection with co-marketing activities, the development of customized and targeted marketing campaigns, to
launch promotions and for other similar advertising efforts. For example:
<br/>
<br/>
<b>● Promotional partners.</b> We disclose personal information to third-party sponsors of promotions to
provide contests, sweepstakes, joint promotional activities or co-branded services, and such
disclosure is necessary to fulfill your request or application. You should carefully review the rules
and/or terms of each promotion in which you participate, as the promotion may contain additional
important information about our, a sponsor's, and/or other third parties' use of your personal
information. To the extent that the rules or terms of those promotions concerning the treatment of your
personal information conflict with this Privacy Policy, the rules of those promotions will control.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>● Ad networks and advertising partners.</b> We work with third-party Ad Networks and Advertising
Partners to deliver advertising and personalized content to you on our Platform and Services, on other
sites and services you may use, and across other devices you may use. These parties may collect
information directly from your browser or device when you visit the Platform through cookies or other
tracking technologies. This collected information is used to provide and inform targeted advertising, as
well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market
research.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>● Social networks.</b> We disclose personal information, such as a unique identifier, hashed email
address, or information automatically collected through tracking technologies, to social networks for
the purpose of displaying personalized advertising and content on those social networks.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>● Select Providers and brands.</b> We disclose necessary personal information to select Providers and
brands from which you have placed orders through the Platform as well as their affiliates and
third-party service providers. Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party
products or services on our site. These sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We
nevertheless seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these third party
sites.
<br/>
<br/>
● These Providers, brands, and their affiliates, may use your information as permitted by their own
privacy policies, which could include sending you marketing communications and other promotional
content.
<br/>
<br/>

information and materials, for example, ratings and reviews, photo uploads, and chat functionality. Please
note that any information you provide in connection with such Services may be available to site visitors and to

Services, and we urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose any other information
and/or materials in these public or interactive areas on the Services.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>3.9. Business Transaction or Reorganization.</b> We may take part in or be involved with a corporate business
transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, or financing or sale of all or a portion of company
assets. We may disclose personal information to a third party during negotiation of, in connection with or as
an asset in such a corporate business transaction. Personal information may also be disclosed in the event of
insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>3.10. Legal Obligations and Rights.</b> We disclose personal information to third parties, such as legal advisors
and law enforcement, as required by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is
necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) enforce our Terms
of Use or to protect the security or integrity of our Services; (c) detect, suppress or prevent fraud or reduce
credit risk and collect debts owed to us; and/or (d) exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety
of Tecton, our visitors, or others.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>3.11. Consent.</b> We may disclose personal information about you to other third parties with your consent.

          <b>4. Control Over Your Personal Information</b>
        </h4>
        <p>
       <b> Profile Settings.</b> We strive very hard to help you easily exercise control on what you share, who it is shared
with and what we can use your data for. You can always update your privacy preferences in the “Your
Account” section of the Services.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Access to your Device Information and Push Notifications.</b> You may control access to your device
information or opt out of push notifications through your “Settings” app on your device. For instance, you can
