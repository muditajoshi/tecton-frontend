                  Ketosis Through Fasting Can Unleash The Mind
                </p>
              </div>
              As hard as it might be to accept it, there are very few decisions
              that the human mind makes independently while interacting in our
              modern societies. We speak at length about freedom of speech and
              our abilities to freely express our thoughts when in fact, the
              reality of our actions and our very thoughts finds its root in the
              methodical conditioning initiated at birth. The first major
              conditioning results from the upbringing imparted, from a
              meaningful childhood flavored by suburban lifestyles and yearly
              exotic vacations, or at the opposite end, abject poverty,
              violence, and reduced access to basic and fundamental rights.

                <b>Our relationship with food</b>
              </p>
              <br />
              At the center of this conditioning is our relationship with food,
              defined and exacerbated by a society that chooses a consumer over
              a human being, any day of the week. It is no wonder then, that
              over half of the American population is obese, suffering from all
              sorts of illnesses related not only to a poor diet but also, and
              more importantly to a mind that has lost or surrendered its
              stewardship to ill-intended outside forces. A subservient mind
              will ultimately impact the body in a negative way and while the
              human body is temporary by design and essence, it was not meant to
              endure the destructive nutritional habits of our modern societies.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our efforts to reclaim the mind through self-realization and
              awareness are a great first step. It will however not provide what
              the mind truly needs to remove its shackles. There are just too
              many outside stimuli for the mind to thoroughly differentiate
              between what it is and what it should aspire to be and if left to
              its own devices, the mind will gravitate toward comfort and the
              status quo.

                <b> Hacking the mind </b>
              </p>
              <br />
              What the mind truly needs is a hack, an intervention, a sort of
              reset by which it temporarily relinquishes its control over the
              body to another entity, and what better entity to take over than
              the body itself functioning in the way it was designed and
              intended to. Engaging in the habits of fasting can help reset the
              mind in understanding what is truly vital and necessary for the
              body to thrive and perform. Fasting is not new. Many religions and
              cultures have advocated for fasting in various forms for thousands
              of years. In fact, as an example, Muslims all over the world have
              been practicing fasting as part of their faith for centuries. It
              is no coincidence, during the holy month of Ramadhan, that the
              reframing of the mind and the upliftment of the soul starts with
              the simple act of fasting, where the body through hunger and
              voluntary starvation claims dominion over the mind and hereby
              focuses it on what matters the most.
              <br />

                  fontSize: "160%",

                <b>The benefits of fasting</b>

              <Link to="/keto-diets" style={{ color: "black" }}>
                <span style={{ color: "black" }}>state of Ketosis</span>
              </Link>
              &nbsp;where the body burns fat as a fuel and is functioning at its
              peak for optimum results and enhanced focus. A secondary effect,
              and possibly one of the most important ones, is the fact that the
              mind is gradually weaning itself off the dependence on stimuli
              from its environment. The newfound awareness of the mind allows
              for better decision-making, gradually leading to a better
              lifestyle or at the very least, a better understanding of what the
              body requires to thrive. <br />
              <br />
              Many have found fasting, intermittent or other, to be liberating
              in support of weight loss and overall better health, but it is
              truly the state of ketosis and the ability to easily access this
              very state that could finally help the mind break free from the
              conditioning designed to keep it happily unaware of the
              destruction it brings to the body.  The next great human evolution
              will not be in the technological advances we are creating but in
              our ability to return to a simpler time where we admit that we
              have enough, and that we already are adequate. 
              <br />
              <br />
              We, at Tecton®, hope that providing an easy and affordable way for
              ordinary people to safely enter into the state of Ketosis will not
              only allow them to become healthier, but will set in motion their
              innate and perhaps dormant desire to want more from the food they
              eat and the society they live in; hopefully focusing their minds
              on what matters most.
