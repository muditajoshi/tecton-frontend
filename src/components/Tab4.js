                  What are the Benefits of Exogenous Ketones
                </p>
              </div>
              It is a uniquely human trait to pursue our highest potential. This
              leads us to try different diets. One popular diet involves
              starving the body of carbohydrates so our livers can produce
              ketones. You may have heard how these “endogenously” produced
              ketones provide some extraordinary benefits, or you may even have
              experienced these for yourself! But, it is a very hard diet for
              most people to follow. The good news is, scientists have managed
              to find a way for us to reap many of the benefits of
              health-promoting ketones without the risks and struggles of
              following a keto diet!
              <br />
              <br />
              The answer? Exogenous ketones. These allow us to get into deep
              ketosis without resorting to restrictive low-carbohydrate diets.
              We can simply consume Tecton® which contains ketones and get into
              deep ketosis in less than 30 minutes.

                <b>Salts vs Esters</b>
              </p>
              <br />
              There are two types of exogenous ketones: ketone salts and ketone
              esters.
              <br />
              <br />
              Ketone salts do not result in the levels of ketones in the blood
              that we need to properly achieve a state of ketosis, and they
              require a lot of sodium, calcium, and/or potassium, which may lead
              to metabolic disturbances such as acidosis in the body.
              <br />
              <br />
              Additionally, the types of ketones that appear in the blood from
              the consumption of ketone salts are not like the ones we produce
              internally, the endogenous ketones.
              <br />
              <p
                class="mob-h-about"
                style={{
                  fontSize: "122%",
                  color: "black",

                  paddingTop: "9px",
                }}
              >
                <b> Nature Identical </b>
              </p>
              <br />
              Ketone esters, as used in Tecton®, are nature identical to
              endogenous ketones and do not require the addition of salts. And
              based on clinical studies, we know that they are both safe and
              well tolerated.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are a lot of clinical trials that provide evidence of ketone
              esters being used to enhance energy, endurance, muscle recovery or
              cognitive performance.

                <b>Drink Tecton® with or without Fasting</b>
              </p>
              By taking an exogenous ketone, such as Tecton®, you will not need
              to resort to prolonged fasting or restrictive low-carbohydrate
              diets to generate ketones.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is a more convenient way to discover your innate extraordinary
              potential. Even if you do decide to fast or follow a Ketogenic
              Diet, Tecton® is a great accompaniment and facilitator of these
              practices, making them easier to follow and tolerate.
